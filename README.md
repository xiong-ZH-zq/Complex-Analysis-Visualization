-----
This is a repository about Complex Analysis Visualization based on Manim Library. As we only study complex analysis for only one semester, some complicated contents will be ignored.

This repository will be taken as our final homework of NKU course "Python Scientific Calculation".

# Tools and Packages
This repositpry won't rely on only one language and tool. Here are the tools that need to be installed.
## Python
- [Manim Community](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim)
- [Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)
- [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib)

## C
- [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib)


# Content
## Basic Knowledge
### Basic knowledge about complex number and geometry
- `ComplexPlane.py` : A simple image of complex plane.
- `AComplexNumber.py` : A complex number example.
### Euler Formula
- `PowerSeriesEuler.py` : Euler formula in power series view.
- `Euler3DSpiral.py` : Euler formula in 3D axis view.

## Complex Fractals
For this part we need to accelerate the program.
- In Python, pytorch or cupy will decrease the running time. And we use pytorch.

### Julia Set
- `Julia Set.py` Julia set image.
- `Julia.c` Julia set animation in raylib.
